        <h2>SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
        <p>
          The common interest that members of the Association share is to
          inspire youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play.
          Any player, coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee
          whose behavior detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary
          action regardless of technical hockey background, expertise,
          accomplishments or standing.

        <h2>IHF FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span>DIMENSIONS.</span> IHF Law 1 provides for flexible external
            field dimensions within a given maximum and minimum width and
            length. These dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by
            teams under 12 and older.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span>COMPETITION FIELDS.</span> Fields used within the competition
            program must be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards.Leagues, districts or
            associations participating in the state competition program that are
            unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must
            advise the State Competition Board which will assign its Fields
            Committee to inspect the field and recommend to the Board whether or
            not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be granted. Teams from
            leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
            acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span> FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</span>
            <ol class="alfabetica">
              <li>
                U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
                areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively
                larger.
              </li>
              <li>
                U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards
                width.
              </li>
              <li>
                U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in
                width.
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their
                internal dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.

          atleast fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program
          are encouraged to play their players 50% of each game.
